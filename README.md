# J.O ReadMe Generator

![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-blue)

## Description
This is a High Level and Professional ReadMe generator that is connected to its own repository for the purpose of demonstrating the functionality of a high level ReadMe created in my first Node Challenge. It includes all the necessary sections and it allows the project creator to devote more time to working on the project. This has been created from the command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the inquirer package.
